## Tricks and Intuition behind some problems
* 205. __Isomorphic Strings__ (Easy): Mark characters at the same index in both the strings point with the same number (`i` in this case). But before doing that, check if they are differently marked. If yes, then that means that this character is mapped to some other character already. So return `False`.
* 448. __Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array__ (Easy): For each number `nums[i]` in `nums`, we mark the number that `nums[i]` points to as negative. Then we filter the list, get all the indexes which points to a positive number.
* 605. __Can Place Flower__ (Easy): Use Greedy approach. Start from start of array. Check if current place is viable (for ends of array consider a 0 padding). If yes, then place a flower there and increment `count` by `1`. If `i = len(arr) - 1` or `count >= n`, then exit loop. Outsided the loop, if `count == n`, then return `True`.
